# CircleUp — Contract Event Payloads

This document is the single source of truth for every event emitted by the
CircleUp smart contracts. The indexer, SDK, and frontend all rely on these
shapes; any on-chain change to a topic or data tuple **must** be reflected here
and in the corresponding `parseXxxEvent` parser in `indexer/src/indexer.ts`.

---

## Encoding rules

Events are Soroban `env.events().publish(topics, data)` calls. The Stellar SDK
deserialises them with `scValToNative`. The shapes described below use the
native-decoded types after that call:

| Soroban type | Native-decoded type |
|---|---|
| `Symbol` | `string` |
| `Address` | `string` (strkey, C- or G-prefix) |
| `u32` | `number` |
| `i128` | `bigint` |
| `bool` | `boolean` |
| tuple `(A, B, C)` | `[A, B, C]` (`Array`) |

**Filter key:** Every event has exactly two symbol topics:
`topic[0]` = contract family (`"factory"`, `"circle"`, `"reputation"`),
`topic[1]` = event name. The indexer uses both to route events.

---

## Factory events

Contract: `CIRCLE_FACTORY_ADDRESS` (env var)

### `factory` / `circle_created`

Emitted at the end of a successful `create_circle` call, after the new circle
has been deployed, initialised, and registered in the factory registry.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"factory"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"circle_created"` |

**Data** — tuple `(Address, Address, u32)`

| Index | Field | Type | Description |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `circle_address` | `string` (C-prefix) | Contract ID of the newly deployed circle |
| 1 | `creator` | `string` (G-prefix) | Wallet that authorised `create_circle` |
| 2 | `circle_index` | `number` | Zero-based factory counter **before** this create. After the event the stored `CircleCount` is `circle_index + 1`. |

**Invariants**
- `circle_index` equals `CircleCount` read immediately before the deploy; it is
  also mixed into the deploy salt together with `creator`, ledger sequence, and
  ledger timestamp to guarantee address uniqueness.
- A failed `create_circle` (validation error, deploy failure, init failure) never
  emits this event and never increments `circle_index`.
- After this event the factory registry (`Circles` + `CircleCount`) has already
  been updated atomically; the indexer can read both in the same ledger.

**Indexer handler:** `handleFactoryCircleCreated` in `indexer/src/indexer.ts`  
**Parser:** `parseCircleCreatedEvent` (exported for unit testing)

---

## Circle events

Contract: per-circle address (discovered from `factory/circle_created`)

All circle events share `topic[0] = "circle"`.

### `circle` / `initialized`

Emitted once at the end of `initialize`, confirming the circle is set up and
ready to accept members.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"circle"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"initialized"` |

**Data** — tuple `(Address, u32, i128)`

| Index | Field | Type | Description |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `circle_address` | `string` | This circle's own contract address |
| 1 | `member_count` | `number` | Number of configured members (= total rounds) |
| 2 | `round_amount` | `bigint` | USDC contribution per member per round (stroops) |

**Indexer note:** The indexer creates the `circles` DB row from the
`factory/circle_created` event, not from this one. This event is currently a
no-op in the ingest pipeline and is present for diagnostic purposes only.

---

### `circle` / `joined`

Emitted when a member successfully locks collateral and joins the circle.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"circle"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"joined"` |

**Data** — tuple `(Address, Address, u32, i128)`

| Index | Field | Type | Description |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `circle_address` | `string` | This circle's contract address |
| 1 | `member` | `string` | Member who joined |
| 2 | `order` | `number` | 1-based join-queue position (1 = first, N = last / triggers Active) |
| 3 | `collateral` | `bigint` | Collateral locked by this member (stroops) |

**Invariants**
- `order` is in `[1, member_count]`.
- When `order == member_count` the circle has transitioned to Active and the
  `circle/active` event follows in the same transaction.

**Indexer handler:** `handleCircleJoined` — updates `circle_members.joined_at`

---

### `circle` / `active`

Emitted immediately after the last member joins, signalling the circle has
transitioned from Pending to Active and the round-0 deadline clock has started.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"circle"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"active"` |

**Data** — `Address` (circle address)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `circle_address` | `string` | This circle's contract address |

**Indexer handler:** `handleCircleActive` — sets `circles.status = 'Active'`

---

### `circle` / `contributed`

Emitted when a member submits a contribution for the current round.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"circle"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"contributed"` |

**Data** — tuple `(Address, Address, u32, i128)`

| Index | Field | Type | Description |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `circle_address` | `string` | Circle contract address |
| 1 | `member` | `string` | Member who contributed |
| 2 | `round_index` | `number` | Zero-based round index this contribution applies to |
| 3 | `amount` | `bigint` | Amount contributed in stroops (equal to `round_amount`) |

**Indexer handler:** `handleCircleContributed` — inserts `contributions` row

---

### `circle` / `payout`

Emitted after the round's designated recipient receives the pooled pot.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"circle"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"payout"` |

**Data** — tuple `(Address, Address, i128, u32)`

| Index | Field | Type | Description |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `circle_address` | `string` | Circle contract address |
| 1 | `recipient` | `string` | Member who received the payout |
| 2 | `amount` | `bigint` | Total pot paid out in stroops (`round_amount × member_count`) |
| 3 | `round_index` | `number` | Zero-based round index that was paid out |

**Invariants**
- `amount` equals `round_amount × member_count` (overflow-safe: the factory and
  circle both pre-check this at init/create time).
- After this event `current_round` advances to `round_index + 1`; if all rounds
  are complete the circle transitions to Completed.

**Indexer handler:** `handleCirclePayout` — inserts `payouts` row, advances
`circles.current_round`

---

### `circle` / `default`

Emitted when a member is marked as having missed the contribution deadline for
the current round. A penalty is deducted from their collateral.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"circle"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"default"` |

**Data** — tuple `(Address, Address, i128, u32, i128)`

| Index | Field | Type | Description |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `circle_address` | `string` | Circle contract address |
| 1 | `member` | `string` | Member who defaulted |
| 2 | `penalty` | `bigint` | Amount deducted from collateral in stroops (`round_amount × PENALTY_BPS / BPS_DENOM`) |
| 3 | `round_index` | `number` | Zero-based round index the default applies to |
| 4 | `new_collateral` | `bigint` | Member's remaining collateral after deduction in stroops |

**Invariants**
- `penalty = round_amount × 2000 / 10000` (20 % of round amount).
- `new_collateral = old_collateral - penalty` (clamped to 0 if exhausted).
- A member can be marked default at most once per round.

**Indexer handler:** `handleCircleDefault` — inserts `defaults` row, increments
`circle_members.defaults`

---

### `circle` / `completed`

Emitted when the last round's payout confirms that all rounds have been paid out
and the circle's ROSCA cycle is complete.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"circle"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"completed"` |

**Data** — `Address` (circle address)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `circle_address` | `string` | This circle's contract address |

**Indexer handler:** `handleCircleCompleted` — sets `circles.status = 'Completed'`

---

### `circle` / `cancelled`

Emitted when a Pending circle is cancelled before all members have joined.
Collateral locked by early joiners is released via a subsequent `close` call.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"circle"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"cancelled"` |

**Data** — tuple `(Address, Address, u64)`

| Index | Field | Type | Description |

| 0 | `circle_address` | `string` | Circle contract address |
| 1 | `caller` | `string` | Address that triggered cancellation |
| 2 | `ledger` | `number` | Ledger sequence at cancellation |

**Indexer handler:** `handleCircleCancelled` — sets `circles.status = 'Cancelled'`

---

### `circle` / `closed`

Emitted when all remaining collateral (and any unreleased funds) have been
returned to members after a Completed or Cancelled circle is closed.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"circle"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"closed"` |

**Data** — tuple `(Address, Address, i128, i128, string)`

| Index | Field | Type | Description |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `circle_address` | `string` | Circle contract address |
| 1 | `closer` | `string` | Address that triggered `close` |
| 2 | `total_released` | `bigint` | Total USDC returned to members in stroops |
| 3 | `total_expected_collateral` | `bigint` | Original collateral sum (before any penalties) in stroops |
| 4 | `reason` | `string` | Human-readable close reason (`"completed"` or `"cancelled"`) |

**Invariants**
- `total_released ≤ total_expected_collateral` (penalties reduce the actual
  amount released when members defaulted).

**Indexer handler:** `handleCircleClosed` — sets `circles.status = 'Closed'`,
writes `total_released` and `close_reason`

---

### `circle` / `paused`

Emitted when the circle admin pauses the circle. All fund-moving operations
(`join`, `contribute`, `payout`, `mark_default`, `close`) are blocked until
a matching `resumed` event.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"circle"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"paused"` |

**Data** — tuple `(Address, Address, u64)`

| Index | Field | Type | Description |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `circle_address` | `string` | Circle contract address |
| 1 | `admin` | `string` | Admin that issued the pause |
| 2 | `ledger` | `number` | Ledger sequence at which the pause took effect |

**Indexer handler:** `handleCirclePaused` — sets `circles.paused = TRUE`

---

### `circle` / `resumed`

Emitted when the circle admin resumes a paused circle. Fund-moving operations
are re-enabled immediately.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"circle"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"resumed"` |

**Data** — tuple `(Address, Address, u64)`

| Index | Field | Type | Description |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `circle_address` | `string` | Circle contract address |
| 1 | `admin` | `string` | Admin that issued the resume |
| 2 | `ledger` | `number` | Ledger sequence at which the resume took effect |

**Indexer handler:** `handleCircleResumed` — sets `circles.paused = FALSE`

---

## Reputation events

Contract: `REPUTATION_ADDRESS` (env var)

All reputation events share `topic[0] = "reputation"`.

### `reputation` / `increment`

Emitted when a circle reports a completed round for a member, incrementing
their reputation score.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"reputation"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"increment"` |

**Data** — `u32` (new total score)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `score` | `number` | Member's new cumulative reputation score |

**Member address:** encoded as `topic[2]` (a third topic `Address`).

**Invariants**
- Only callers registered via `add_authorized_caller` (factory-deployed circles)
  can emit this event.
- Score is monotonically non-decreasing — a member's reputation can only grow.

**Indexer handler:** `handleReputationIncrement` — upserts `reputation` row

---

### `reputation` / `score_updated`

Emitted on every successful `increment` call in addition to the `increment`
event above. Carries both the member address and the full new score for
consumers that only subscribe to score change events.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"reputation"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"score_updated"` |

**Data** — tuple `(Address, u32)`

| Index | Field | Type | Description |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `member` | `string` | Member address |
| 1 | `new_total_score` | `number` | Member's new cumulative score |

**Indexer note:** The indexer does not currently process this event (the
`increment` event carries sufficient information). It is present for external
consumers that need a self-contained score-change notification.

---

### `reputation` / `caller_added`

Emitted when the factory registers a new circle as an authorized reputation
caller.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"reputation"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"caller_added"` |

**Data** — `Address`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `circle` | `string` | Circle contract address that was granted call rights |

---

### `reputation` / `caller_removed`

Emitted when the factory de-registers a circle from the authorized caller list.

**Topics**

| Index | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `Symbol` | `"reputation"` |
| 1 | `Symbol` | `"caller_removed"` |

**Data** — `Address`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `circle` | `string` | Circle contract address that had its call rights revoked |

---

## Event ordering guarantees

1. Within a single transaction events are emitted in source-code order; the
   indexer processes them in `event.id` ascending order to preserve this.
2. `factory/circle_created` is always the last event in a successful
   `create_circle` transaction — the circle's own `circle/initialized` event
   fires before it (inside the `invoke_contract` call at step 5).
3. `circle/active` fires in the same transaction as the last member's
   `circle/joined` event. The indexer relies on this to advance status in one
   ledger batch.
4. `circle/completed` fires in the same transaction as the final round's
   `circle/payout` event.

## Stability contract

Topics (topic[0] and topic[1]) and the **order and types** of data tuple fields
are considered stable. Adding a new trailing field to a data tuple is a
backwards-compatible change; reordering or removing fields is a breaking change
that requires a new event name.

Any breaking change must:
1. Update this document.
2. Update the corresponding `parseXxxEvent` / `handleXxxEvent` pair in
   `indexer/src/indexer.ts`.
3. Add or update tests in `indexer/src/indexer.test.ts` covering the new shape.
4. Bump the relevant contract version comment in the Rust source.
